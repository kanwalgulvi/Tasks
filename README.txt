# Tasks
Task #1

1. Create a new myCar object for a car. Add some properties, including, but not limited to, make and model, and values for a typical car or your car. Feel free to use booleans, strings, or numbers.
2. Create a variable that can hold the string value color. This variable containing a string value color can now be used to reference the property name within myCar. Then, use the variable within the square bracket notation to assign a new value to the color property in myCar.
3. Use that same variable and assign a new property string value to it, such as forSale. Use the bracket notation once again to assign a new value to the forSale property to indicate whether the car is available for purchase.
4. Output make and model into the console.
5. Output the value of forSale into the console.

Task #2

1. Create an object named people that contains an empty array that is called friends.
2. Create three variables, each containing an object, that contain one of your friend's first names, last names, and an ID value.
3. Add the three friends to the friend array.
4. Output it to the console.

Task #3

Take the following array:

 const theList = ['Laurence', 'Svekis', true, 35, null, undefined,
{test: 'one', score: 55}, ['one', 'two']]; 


Manipulate your array using various methods, such as pop(), push(), shift(), and unshift(), and transform it into the following:

["FIRST", "Svekis", "MIDDLE", "hello World", "LAST"] 


Task #4

In this project, you will implement a data structure for a product catalog and create queries to retrieve data.

1. Create an array to hold an inventory of store items.
2. Create three items, each having the properties of name, model, cost, and quantity.
3. Add all three objects to the main array using an array method, and then log the inventory array to the console.
4. Access the quantity element of your third item, and log it to the console. Experiment by adding and accessing more elements within your data structure3
